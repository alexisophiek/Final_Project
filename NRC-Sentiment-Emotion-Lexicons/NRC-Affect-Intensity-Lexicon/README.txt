GENERAL DESCRIPTION
************************************************************

The NRC Affect Intensity Lexicon is a list of English words and their
associations with four basic emotions (anger, fear, sadness, joy). 

Words can be associated with different intensities (or degrees) of an emotion.
For example, most people will agree that the word condemn is associated with a
greater degree of anger (or more anger) than the word irritate. However,
annotating instances for fine-grained degrees of affect is a substantially more
difficult undertaking than categorical annotation: respondents are presented
with greater cognitive load and it is particularly hard to ensure consistency
(both across responses by different annotators and within the responses produced
by the same annotator). Here, for the first time, we create an affect intensity
lexicon with real-valued scores of association using best--worst scaling.

For a given word and emotion X, the scores range from 0 to 1. A score of 1 means
that the word conveys the highest amount of emotion X.  A score of 0 means that
the word conveys the lowest amount of emotion X.

The lexicon has close to 6,000 entries for four basic emotions: anger, fear,
joy, and sadness. (We will soon be adding entries for four more emotions: trust,
disgust, anticipation, and surprise. We will also be adding entries for valence,
arousal, and dominance.) It includes common English terms as well as terms
that are more prominent in social media platforms, such as Twitter. It includes
terms that are associated with emotions to various degrees. For a given emotion,
this even includes some terms that may not predominantly convey that emotion (or
that convey an antonymous emotion), and yet tend to co-occur with terms that do.
(Antonymous terms tend to co-occur with each other more often than chance, and
are particularly problematic when one uses automatic co-occurrence-based
statistical methods to capture word--emotion connotations.)



************************************************************
FILE FORMAT
************************************************************

Each line has the following format:
<Term><tab><Score><tab><AffectDimension>

<Term> is a word for which the annotations are provided;

<Score> is the real-valued emotion intensity score;

<AffectDimension> is one of the emotions (anger, fear, joy, or sadness).
