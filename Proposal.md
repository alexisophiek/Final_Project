## Twitter Sentiment Analysis

_Add a sentence or two about the scope of your topic_


## Rationale 

_Add a paragraph or two describing why this data is interesting or relevant to you and your audience. What do you want you audience to take away. Are there questions you're trying to answer? Note: this section is likely to change as you work with your data, but it's helpful to have an idea at this point._
